# Estimating Obesity Levels Using Supervised Learning

## Description

This project applies supervised machine learning to estimate obesity levels in individuals from Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. The aim is to predict whether a person has obesity using classification models implemented with the scikit-learn library. The models used include:

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Naive Bayes**  
- **Logistic Regression**

The dataset used for this project is publicly available and titled:  
[ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition).
